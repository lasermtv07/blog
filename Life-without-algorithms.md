# Life without addictive algorithms
Hello. While I wanted this to be mainly a technical blog, I want to address one thing here that is not my invention, but sometimes really drives me insane. I predict it's going to be a big challenge for me and other people alike.

So for most of my life, I have been using services like YouTube and.. mainly YouTube the way most people use it; on the official frontend (youtube.com) logged into my Google account here. Thus, I got really good recommendation made by the algorithms.
However, this had flaws, too. For one, there were the *ads*. I was fine by them at first, but as YouTube started added more and more, it became very frustrating to just use the platform. For three minute song, I ended up watching 2 minutes of ads.
Furthermore, sometimes I played it on headphones and etc. and got that annoying shit when video didnt autoplay after ad ended. So I started getting fed up. Furthermore, if I wanted to download a video, I had to use a sketchy websites that gave me trojan more often than the video
I wanted *(that was before I found about [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl))*. And also required loading nonfree Javascript. While I am no RMS and use more proprietary platforms than I want, cutting one from my stack would be
pleasant. The webdesign of the official frontend is absolutelly awful, slow and full of javascript bloat.

It started nagging me more and more, and then one friend showed me the beauty of alternative frontends. He recommended Piped and LibreTube, however I ended up using Invidious and PipePipe *(a NewPipe fork that I found randomly scrolling
thru the Fdroid repos and that also has frontend for NicoNico Doughi, BiliBili and PeerTube - a Japanese video sharing website, a big Chinese video sharing website and a decentralized video platform with support of the BitTorrent protocol)*. These
services I ended up using.

One thing, however, that I gave up with these platform, is the addictive algorithms. I found it a plus at first, but as Im typing this, it was also a big ***sacrifise***. These algorithms, while they took away lots of time, mental energy and 
motivation were very addictive. Not because the youtube videos were any good, lets be honest, most youtube videos including mine are absoulute dumpsterfire. However, they take away boredom. Sure, there were
[some researches](https://invidious.fdn.fr/watch?v=LKPwKFigF8U) to prove that boredom is healthy, I frankly dont care. My reason for quitting it were, as said beforehand, b=very pragmatic. One thing not mentioned, as a sorta final push for a switch,
were cookies. I started autoclearing most of my histroy, including cookies,which logged me outta Google account. Back to the track, being several months without these algorithms is, sometimes, very painful. One thing can be addiction to cheap
pushes of dopamine into the brain, however one thing can be simply boredom. While I thought I can occupy myself differenly, most of the time I cant. I come home from school exteremely tired, pop down a coffe and just lie in bed. However, I just lie
in bed and try to not die. Then, after minutes to hours of tormenting boredom, I try to do something, just to fail, reimburse imposter syndrome, and go back to bed. Motivation I sometimes get in the evening, like now, typing this post at 22:50 (10:50 PM)
in the evening. I dont even know what I am trying to achieve here by typing it; i dont even know why I torment myself in this way. I cant talk here about all of my problem here anyways, without full context it doesnt even make sense and have no why it
even exist, but fuck it, Im publishing it.
