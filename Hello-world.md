# hello world
Hi, this is just a hello world article, a filler you might say. It is today that I am finishig this website and I wanna have some content in all categories, so i'm making something like this.
While, yes, I made this website in like three days, I still like it. What do you think :) It's (except the webprojects and the copy button) written purely in HTML and CSS. I know have some fun projects
idea that ill be posting here, so looking forward to that :) anyways, I have no more stuff to write about, so bye
